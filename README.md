# ATPMS---Project
Autonomous Traffic Police Management System (ATPMS). A blockchain and AI-powered platform to automate violation management, ensure evidence integrity via IPFS, and provide bilingual legal support to modernize Sri Lankan traffic enforcement
# Autonomous Traffic Police Management System (ATPMS) 

## AI-Driven Framework for Decentralized Evidence Management, Legal Intelligence, and Traffic Safety

This project develops an integrated digital ecosystem to modernize traffic law enforcement in Sri Lanka. By leveraging Blockchain (IPFS/ZKP), Multimodal AI (NLP/Vision), and Real-time Data Analytics, the system provides a transparent, tamper-proof, and automated platform for both officers and citizens.
